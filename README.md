The analyzing code files have been performed in three different python environments and thus are now placed on different branches.
Each branch contains its own recommended environment file to reproduce the figures in /Figure/.
Content of each branch is summarized as follows:
  - Branch "main": Most of the analyzing and plotting code.
  - Branch "108":  VAE training and evaluation related code.
  - Branch "39":   TaiwanVVM simulation related code.

For reproducing the figures, generated-data can be accessed through the following link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wYgGreO44OVylNQEmOsnpRON1-3HD2t2?usp=sharing) or can be generated through the code files provided.
Other large downloadable datasets are stated in the Data Availability section.
